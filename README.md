# Car Rentals Web Application 🚗
## Overview ✏️
This is the final project for the course Software Development with Proprietary Technology I (ISO-605) at Universidad APEC.
Throughout the semester, we collaboratively developed Car Rentals, a full-featured web application for a car rental dealership.

Car Rentals streamlines the operational workflow of a car rental business, providing administrative tools to manage vehicles, clients, rental and return processes, inspections, and more — all through a modern and intuitive web interface.
